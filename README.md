# Aristophanis Canticorum Omniorum Responsio Accentuum

![Editio Princeps](media/editio-princeps.jpg)

See [this notebook](nb_results.ipynb) for the results. The data are available in a custom XML format in the ```data/compiled``` folder. 

## Corpus

The corpus consists of all the **78** Aristophanic cantica (songs, chorals) that have responding strophes, i.e. that are either antistrophic (exactly two strophes) or polystrophic (that have 3 or 4 strophes):

- ✅ Ach.: 9 (1 polystr. with 4 str.)
- ✅ Eq.: 8, alla körer! (1 polystr. with 4 str.)
- ✅ Nu.: 6
- ✅ V.: 8
- ✅ Pax: 6 (1 polystr. with 3 str.)
- ✅ Av.: 10
- ✅ Lys.: 8 (1 polystr. with 4 str.)
- ✅ Th.: 4
- ✅ Ra.: 11 (2 polystr. with 3 and 4 str. resp.)
- ✅ Ec.: 6 
- ✅ Pl.: 2

As seen above, only 6 songs (≈ 7.6%) are polystrophic, only 3 of which have 4 strophes. 

## Copyright and citation

That science is "open" should be an analytical truth, since without transparency of method and sharing of data there can be no true replicability and hence no interesting peer review (you can't *RE*-view what you aren't allowed to *view* in the first place!). Sadly, its not, and so I have to explicitly state that this repository is under the copyleft GNU GPL 3 license, which means you are more than welcome to fork and build on this software for your own open-science research.
