In ancient Greek theatre, choral poetry and music were inseparable.
Choruses didn’t simply recite lines; they sang them with melodic and rhyth-
mic precision. An key question is, did the Greek pitch accent influence the
composition of these verse songs?
For nearly half a century after Erik Wahlström’s pioneering but method-
ologically simplistic affirmative answer to that question in 1970, scholars of
pre-Hellenistic Greek poetry largely overlooked the contribution of phone-
mic tone.
The turning point came first for stichic verse (Abritta 2015, 2018), and
continued with results for antistrophic lyric (songs with exactly two metri-
cally equal refrains) through Anna Conser’s (2020, 2021, 2024) pioneering
computational approach.
Yet this revival of attention to phonemic tone in Greek metre still mostly
centers on the three tragedians, leaving comedy and lyric unexamined.
Aristophanes stands out as the only dramatist whose preserved plays include
polystrophic lyric (songs with more than two metrically equal refrains),
which imposes stricter constraints on recurring phenomena. Aristophanes’
choral passages thus make the ideal testing ground for whether phonemic
tone played a large enough role in Greek metre to merit renewed scholarly
attention.
This study computationally analyses the 79 strophic songs of Aristo-
phanes using three metrics: one based on accents as written characters,
another treating accent as a phonemic phenomenon and a third linking ac-
cent to melodic contour in the way suggested by Conser.
