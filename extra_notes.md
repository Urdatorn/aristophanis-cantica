## Hypotheses to test

There are three separate statistical analyses:

- Count accents/προσῳδίαι straight off
  - Might prove that grave responsion is not statistically significant
- Count βαρύς and ὀξύς, where
  - a heavy syll is βαρύς if it has circumflex or the preceeding syll has an acute 
  - a syll is ὀξύς if it has an acute and the subsequent syll is light
- Count compatible syllables

These metrics should also be run on subsets of 
- rhythmic genres:
  - on trochaic verses only
  - on iambic verses only
  - on Aeolic verses only
  - on the two songs of "undeveloped Attic dactylo-epitrite", av02 and Ran. 674ff~706ff
- individual plays

We search for statistical development
- between the songs within a play (are the earlier or latter more responding? Linear dev?)
- between all plays
  - do "virtuosic" plays (such as Av. acc. to Parker, and arguably Ra.) stand out in any way?
- between machine generated clusters of plays!
- inside a song, e.g. if as in V. 526 (νῦν δὴ...) the opening 7 cola have no responsion while the last 6 all have. For such a corrupt text, that can also be a possible indicator of reliability

We also need to show
- the degree of dependence between word-end distribution and accent distribution and
- how often word-end responsion and accentual responsion come together
